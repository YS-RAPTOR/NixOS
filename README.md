### TMUX

- When opening a terminal window it should always default to making a new window within the currently selected session. The window should be inside the current working directory.
    - Opening Terminal
    - Session created
        - No
            - Create a new session with a simple name
        - Yes
            - Get the session name
            - Get the cwd
            - Open a new window within the session and cwd

- When closing a terminal window
    - Should close the window it is attached to
    - If it is the last window the session has it should terminate the session

- Hyrpland
    - When doing Ctrl / you should alternate between workspace 1 and 2

- Remove all pane stuff
- Change keybinds of session manager
- Add <C-/> functionality to hyprland somehow. Maybe switch between workspace 1 and 2? Maybe more sophisticated mechanism
